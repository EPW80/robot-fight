# Robot-Fight

Welcome to Robot-Fight, where steel meets fury! This is a simple yet immersive robot combat game, where the objective is to attack and deplete your opponent's HP. Remember, the first one whose HP reaches zero loses. This project was created to apply and demonstrate our understanding of programming concepts through a fun and interactive platform. The player engages in a battle against their robotic opponent, trading blows and reducing each other's HP.
